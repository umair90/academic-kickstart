abstract: Emotions are vital to our lives but could be difficult to recognize and understand. Traditional visualizations of emotions tend to be time-series graph on screen displays limiting user engagement in their real-time sense-making. This paper explores the feasibility of smart materials for developing novel dynamic displays on skin for real time visualization of affective data. We report prototyping two such displays and their evaluation with 6 participants, and discuss their qualities such as ambiguity, slowly unfolding change, and lack of light emission together with their temporal constraints and private-public tension for affective meaning disclosure.
